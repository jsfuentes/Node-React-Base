# Node-React-Base
This project contains two parts: a React frontend created using react-starter and a NodeJS/Express backend created using express generator. There have been slight modifications to both that proxy the React requests to the express backend. 

## Setup
In both the client and backend folders run:
```
npm install
```
In the main folder:
```
npm install
```

Finally, in the main folder, run both servers with the frontend available at localhost:3000 with 
```
npm start
```
